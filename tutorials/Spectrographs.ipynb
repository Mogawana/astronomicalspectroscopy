    "(1) Spectrographs are common instruments on 10m class telescopes.  We have described two of these instruments in detail for SALT.   Now, look up a spectrograph on one of the other 10m class telescopes (Keck, VLT, Gemini, GTC, HET) in the world (these can usually be found by going to the instruments web page for the telescopes) and describe the instrument.  \n",
